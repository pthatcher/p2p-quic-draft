1.  Introduction

   ICE is a protocol for establishing peer-to-peer (p2p) connections.
   It can be combined with client-server protocols such as DTLS and SCTP
   for p2p connections.  QUIC is a client-server protocol.  This
   document describes how to use ICE with QUIC for p2p QUIC connections.

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  ALPN

   The QUIC ALPN MUST be "q2q".

4.  (De)multiplexing ICE and QUIC

   QUIC packets MUST be sent using the ICE selected candidate pair.

   ICE and QUIC packets are demultiplexed using the STUN magic cookie.
   If a packet contains a STUN magic cookied, it MUST treated as an ICE
   packet.  If it does not contain a STUN magic cookie, it SHOULD be
   treated as a QUIC packet (but further demultiplexing between QUIC and
   other protocols is possible).

5.  Signaling

   In addition to all signaling necessary for ICE (ICE parameters and
   candidates), the following information MUST be signaled or otherwise
   negotiated between the peers: - Which side will take on the active
   (client) or passive (server) role. - Certificate fingerprint(s) -
   Whether or not to enable the grease bit - Whether or not to the
   MuliplexingID is used

6.  Certificate verification

   Peers MAY use self-signed certificates.  Each peer MUST verify the
   certificate, meaning a QUIC implementation MUST support a server
   verifying a client certificate.

7.  Grease bit

   Peers SHOULD enable and use the grease bit.

8.  Multipath

   QUIC multipath SHOULD NOT be used unless it is known that one of the
   peers is a server.

9.  QUIC datagrams

   QUIC datagrams SHOULD be supported.

10.  Congestion control

   A real-time congestion control algorithm SHOULD be used, which may
   require extensions to QUIC (such as additional timestamps in feedback
   messages) and additional signaling.

11.  QUIC Pings

   ACKed QUIC PING frames MAY be treated the same as a succesful ICE
   check, such that a peer may choose to send QUIC PING frames instead
   of ICE checks once an ICE candidate pair has had at least one
   successful ICE check.

12.  Network Migration

   Network migration SHOULD be done using ICE, not QUIC.  But ICE
   migrates between candidate pairs, QUIC should change behavior (such
   as congestion control) as if it had done a network migration, but it
   SHOULD NOT change the connection ID due to ICE migration.

13.  MultiplexingID

   Because it is often difficult to obtain an ICE connection, it is
   often advantageous to multiplex many uses over a single ICE
   connection.  For example, one may wish to send control data, real-
   time audio and video, and real-time data altogether over the same ICE
   connection.  If all of these uses are done using QUIC, there must be
   a way to distinguish multiple uses of QUIC within the same QUIC
   connection, both for streams and for datagrams.

   The MultiplexingID is an optional, variable-length integer at the
   beginning of every QUIC datagram and stream.  If it is negotiated to
   be used, it MUST be included on every datagram and stream.  If it is
   not negotiated to be used, it MUST not be included on any datagram or
   stream.

   The variable-length encoding is the same as used by QUIC, as defined
   in section 16.

14.  SDP

   If SDP is used for signaling, the media type may be "audio", "video",
   or "application".  The transport protocol MUST be "UDP/QUIC".  The
   media format may be any value describing the protocol used on top of
   QUIC, which would be defined by other specifications or by
   applications (for example, "moq" or "roq").  The ICE parameters and
   candidates are signaled as defined by ICE ("a=ice-ufrag", "a=ice-
   pwd", "a=ice-options", "a=candidate").  The QUIC role and
   fingerprints are signaled using the same attributes as DTLS
   ("a=setup", and "a=fingerprint").  QUIC options are negotiated the
   same as ICE options but with an "a=quic-options" field.  The grease
   bit defaults to off unless a QUIC option of "grease" is included.
   The MultiplexingID is signaled using an "a=mid" line, and the value
   MUST be a base-10 integer.  If any "a=mid" is specified in any QUIC
   m-section in a BUNDLE group, then all QUIC m-sections in the same
   BUNDLE group MUST have an "a=mid" specified.

   For example: v=0 o=- 4962303333179871722 1 IN IP4 0.0.0.0 s=- t=0 0
   a=ice-ufrag:7sFv a=ice-pwd:dOTZKZNVlO9RSGsEGM63JXT2 a=ice-

15.  Security Considerations

   This document is subject to the security considerations of ICE and
   QUIC.
